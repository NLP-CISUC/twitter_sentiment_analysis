# Twitter Dialogues for Sentiment Analysis
The Twitter Dialogues for Sentiment Analysis corpus contains Twitter IDs from dialogues, to be used in the evaluation of Sentiment in dialogue systems.

The Twitter accounts used are related to TeleCommunications, Healthcare, and e-Commerce.

The annotation was performed manually and achieved moderate agreement between the annotators. 
The multi-class labels range from Very Negative (-2) to Positive (1), and have an average of 0.48+/-0.13 using the Fleiss metric, and an average of 0.66+/-0.16 using the Krippendorff. 
The binary labels represent Negative and Non-Negative sentiment and have an average of 0.67+/-0.16 in both metrics.

They are represented in an .xlsx file containing the following eleven headers:

- Tweet_ID: ID of each Tweet
- Dialog_ID: ID representing the Tweets belonging to the same dialogue
- Median_Multiclass: Median of the 3 annotations for the multi-class scenario
- Median_Binary: Median of the 3 annotations for the binary scenario
- Annot_1_M: Annotation of annotator 1 for the multi-class scenario
- Annot_2_M: Annotation of annotator 2 for the multi-class scenario
- Annot_3_M: Annotation of annotator 3 for the multi-class scenario
- Annot_1_B: Annotation of annotator 1 for the binary scenario
- Annot_2_B: Annotation of annotator 2 for the binary scenario
- Annot_3_B: Annotation of annotator 3 for the binary scenario
- Speaker: Identification of the author of the tweet as USER or SERVICE
